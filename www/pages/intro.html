                                <strong>Web development</strong> broadly refers to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or Internet. <br /><br />

                                    The<strong> Web development process</strong> includes Web design, Web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.<br />

                                    Web development is also known as website development.

                            <h3>Web Development Overview</h3>
                            <div class="content-body" >
                                <strong>There are two broad divisions of web development</strong>  – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).<br /><br />

                                <div class="main-topic-wrap">
                                    <strong> Front-end development</strong> refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                               

                               <strong>HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language,</strong> is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application.<br /><br />
 

                              <strong>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets,</strong>  is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. <br /><br />

                              Finally, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a scripting language that’s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.

                     <!--slider item-->
                    <div class="swiper-slide" style="text-align:center">
                        <span></span>
                        <div>
                            <div class="content-body" >
                                <strong>Back-end development</strong> controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end..<br /><br />

                                <div class="main-topic-wrap">
                                    <strong>Back-end scripts</strong> are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as…

                                        <li>Java</li>
                                        <li>Node.js</li>
                                        <li>Python</li>
                                    </ul>
